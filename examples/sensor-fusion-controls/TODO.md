- package it for a three.js examples
  - maybe a compass

- take webvr-polyfill as git submodules
- build a standalone library which contains a three.js controller
- propose to hand it over to them

# how to develop on desktop
- record devicemotion events in mobile
- output it with console.log
- use a remote debugger to get those value back
- and put those value in its own js file
- then replay all the events in desktop

# Possible use
- possible to use this as camera controls for webvr ?
- possible to use this with a phone. the phone read the orientation, send that to the display which handle it as a pointer
